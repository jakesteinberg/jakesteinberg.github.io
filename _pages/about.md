Hi, my name is Jake :)  

I'm a currently a postdoctoral investigator at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutiuon and member of the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io). Prior to starting this position in May 2020 I completed my PhD at the University of Washington in physical oceanography (2020) where my thesis work centered on the use of autonomous underwater vehicles to explore eddy structure, evolution, and decay through the lens of mesoscale turbulence. I have a masters degree in applied mathematics and a bachelors of science in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Maryland. 

My research focuses on using observations to better understand and parameterize mesoscale eddies. With this improved understanding we can better quantify the role eddies play in momentum and tracer transport. I am interested in submeso-/meso-scale ocean dynamics, but also how people interact with the ocean. 

As a graduate student I have spent time in the field deploying/recovering instruments and in the classroom teaching undergraduates and graduates in fluid mechanics and GFD. 

I grew up in Philadelphia, PA and in my free time I'm likely cycling, running, swimming, or mountaineering.
