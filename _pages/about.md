Hi, my name is Jake :)  

Prior to starting as a postdoc at WHOI in May 2020 I completed my PhD at the University of Washington in physical oceanography (March 2020) where my thesis work focused on the use of autonomous underwater vehicles ([Seaglider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPeLpNZB5UY) and [Deepglider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxj1SBWSHN8)) to explore eddy structure, evolution, and decay through the lens of mesoscale turbulence. As a graduate student I have spent time in the field deploying/recovering instruments and in the classroom teaching undergraduates and graduates in fluid mechanics and geophysical fluid dynamics. During my time at UW I also completed a masters degree in applied mathematics. This graduate work at UW followed four years at the University of Maryland where I obtained a bachelors of science in Civil and Environmental Engineering.  

In addition to my research, I am interested how people interact with the ocean and percieve its role in Earth's climate. Prior to entering the field of physical oceanogrpahy, my studies at the University of Maryland were focused on water resources (i.e. surface water hydrology, ground water hydrology, and coastal ocean engineering). This background has shaped my relationship with physical oceanography. Because my efforts to observe the ocean arose at UW through the new development and use of autonomous underwater vehicles, I often had the opportunity to share our work with students and the public. Approaching oceanography and explaining our scientific efforts in this applied manner, especially in a place like Seattle with water all around us, makes engaging with others easier and more rewarding. In my continued work I think connecting with others lies in the shared excitement of applying new technologies to understand how the ocean affects us all.  

Outside of work I like to run, climb, bike, swim, read, make coffee, and xc-ski. Recent favorite books are: Debt: The First 5000 Years (Graeber), Children of Time (Tchaikovsky), A Manual for Cleaning Women (Berlin), Killing Commendatore (Murakami), Circe (Miller) ...
