Mesoscale turbulence represents a major fraction of oceanic kinetic energy yet these motions are only at best partly resolved in global climate models. This research incorporates in-situ and remote sensing measurements of ocean eddies to better understand what sets the distribution of energy across horizontal and vertical scales with the intent of improving parameterizations in coarse models. 

* [NASA Ocean Surface Topography from Space: 30-Year Satellite-Altimeter Record or Regional Sea-Level Change](https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/1688/?list=projects) (w C. Piecuch, B. Hamlington, P. Thompson, S. Coats)
While global mean trends in sea level have remained positive over the last 30 years, regional trends vary significantly in space and time. To better understand the physical drivers of these observed trends, we used the [ECCO state estimate](https://ecco-group.org/home.cgi) along with remotely observed and in-situ measurements, to quantify relationships among ocean bottom pressure, steric height, and sea level.
