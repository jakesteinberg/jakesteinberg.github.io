current projects 
* [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io) (with Sylvia Cole) 
* [NASA Ocean Surface Topography from Space: 30-Year Satellite-Altimeter Record or Regional Sea-Level Change](https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/1688/?list=projects) (with Christopher Piecuch)

interests:
* mesoscale turburlence  
    + scale energy flux (inverse and forward cascades) 
* eddy vertical structre 
    + surface projection of interior motions: reconstructing interior flows from surface observations
    + role of bathymetry in setting the partitioing of barotropic and baroclinic kinetic energy 
    + drivers of kinetic energy dissipation at the sea floor 
* regional patterns of sea level change  
    + ocean bottom pressure and steric height connections to sea level  
* coherent vortex evolution and decay
    + eddy tracking (in-situ and via remote sensing) and material transport 
    + applied topology (eddy geometries and connectedness) 
* remote sensing (satellite oceanography) 
    + along-track altimeter derived sea surface height 
* Seaglider & Deepglider AUVs
    + deep ocean water mass transformation (spice variability)
