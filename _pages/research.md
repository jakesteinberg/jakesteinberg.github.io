current projects 
* [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io) (with Sylvia Cole) 
* [NASA Ocean Surface Topography from Space: 30-Year Satellite-Altimeter Record or Regional Sea-Level Change](https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/1688/?list=projects) (with Chris Piecuch)

interests:
* eddy evolution and decay
    + eddy tracking and material transport 
* mesoscale turburlence 
    + partitioning of eddy kinetic/potential energy 
    + energy transfers across scales (the inverse cascade) 
* eddy vertical structre 
    + the surface projection of interior motions 
    + bottom dissipation of kinetic energy 
* satellite oceanography 
    + along-track sea surface height 
* Seaglider & Deepglider AUVs
    + deep ocean water mass transformation (spice variability) 
* relationships among ocean bottom pressure, steric height, and sea surface height 
    + spatial patterns in ocean warming
