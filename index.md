I am an observational physical oceanographer interested in mesoscale turbulence and eddy behavior. 

What is an eddy? This question is kind of a funny one and answers tend to vary with application and/or scientific question being asked. An eddy can be broadly defined as an anomalous current relative to a spatial or temporal mean. But the term is often used in reference to a circular current of water or air, swirling around as a coherent feature. This definition is a bit restrictive. I am interested in ocean energetics, the movement of water, at mesoscales and thus take a more general definition of eddy to be any individual manifestation of oceanic turbulence. Those swirling features (coherent vortices) that can live for many months while transiting ocean basins are uniquely interesting and I am interested in their fate, but these days I focus more on the role eddies play in moving energy around the globe.  

The figure below reveals the radial structure of a coherent eddy, but also shows where and how measurements were collected enabling the investigation of this eddy's evolution. In plan view referenced to the center of a submesoscale coherent vortex, red and blue arrows are velocity vectors estimated by Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicles. The green circles indicate the vertical distance separating two density surfaces, one above and one below the core depth of this eddy (~ 200 meters).
