I am an observational physical oceanographer interested in mesoscale turbulence and eddy behavior. 

Of the many shapes, sizes, and types of eddies found in the ocean, I'm interested in those that can live for many months while effectively trapping and transporting things like heat and oxygen over many hundreds of kilometers. These coherent vortices make up one type of eddy that all have vertical structures spanning the water column. While many eddies can be observed from alimetric observations of sea surface height, many go un-noticed. My interests in eddy vertical structures range from topographic steering to decomposing surface observations into interior contributions.      

The figure below reveals the radial structure of a coherent eddy, but also shows where and how measurements were collected enabling the investigation of this eddy's evolution. In plan view referenced to the center of a submesoscale coherent vortex, red and blue arrows are velocity vectors estimated by Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicles. The green circles indicate the vertical distance separating two density surfaces, one above and one below the core depth of this eddy (~ 200 meters).
