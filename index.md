I am an observational physical oceanographer interested in mesoscale turbulence and eddy behavior. 

Of the many shapes, sizes, and types of eddies found in the ocean, I'm interested in those that can live for many months while effectively trapping and transporting things like heat and oxygen over many hundreds of kilometers. These coherent vortices make up one type of eddy that all have vertical structures spanning the water column. While larger/persistent eddies can be observed from altimetric observations of sea surface height, many are missed because they are too small or sub-surface intensified. My interests in eddy vertical structures thus range from topographic steering to decomposing surface observations into interior contributions.      

The figure below details efforts to persistently observe a single submesoscale coherent vortex using two Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicles. The radial structure and symmetry of this coherent eddy can be seen in the colored depth-average current vector estimates. The locations of these vectors identify glider collected profiles relative to an estimate of the moving eddy center. In plan view, red and blue arrows are 0-1000m depth-average velocity vectors, green circles indicate the vertical distance separating two density surfaces (one above and one below the core depth at ~ 200 meters) (larger circles correspond to greater vertical separation), and the colored contours map a cost function whose minization determines a best estimate of the eddy center location over a ~ 2 week period.
