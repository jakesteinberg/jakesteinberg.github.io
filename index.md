I am an observational physical oceanographer interested in mesoscale turbulence and eddy behavior. 

This figure details both eddy structure and methods used to study these features. In plan view referenced to the center of a submesoscale coherent vortex, red and blue arrows are velocity vectors estimated by Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicles. The green circles indicate the vertical distance separating two density surfaces, one above and one below the core depth of this eddy (~ 200 meters).
